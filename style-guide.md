# 📘 Technical Documentation Style Guide

by Vanitha Nanaiah - Technical Writer & Software Engineer

This guide outlines my approach to writing clear, consistent, and user-focused technical documentation.


---
## 1. Writing Principles

- Clarity First

  - Break information into short, manageable sections

  - Avoid unnecessary technical jargon

  - Use examples and visuals whenever helpful


-  Active Voice

    - Prefer: “Click the Submit button.”

    - Avoid: “The Submit button should be clicked.”


- Accuracy

  - Verify workflows in real environments

  - Test API calls before documenting them

  - Confirm variable names, parameters, and responses

## 2. Consistency Rules

- Tone

- Professional but friendly

- Empathetic to beginner-level users

- Developer-first when writing API docs

- Terminology

- Use consistent names for features

- Spell out abbreviations on first use\
  Example: Representational State Transfer (REST)
- UI Elements

    Format UI elements in bold:

    - Settings

   -  Create Account

    - Submit


    Code Blocks

          {
            "status": "success",
            "userId": "12345"
          }

## 3. Document Types I Create

- API Documentation
  - Endpoints

  - Methods (GET, POST, etc.)

  - Request & response bodies

  - Error messages

  - Example code snippets

  - Authentication flow explanations


- User Guides

  - Task-based structure

  - Screenshots with callouts

  - Expected outputs


- Tutorials

    - Step-by-step

    - Learning-oriented

    - Includes warnings, tips, troubleshooting

## 4. Visual Documentation Tools

I use:

- Markdown diagrams

- System architecture sketches

- Annotated screenshots

- Draw.io

---

## 5. Review Checklist

Before publishing any document:

- Spelling and grammar

- Consistent formatting

- Document structure validated

- Technical accuracy verified

- Code samples tested

- Broken links removed

- Updated screenshots
